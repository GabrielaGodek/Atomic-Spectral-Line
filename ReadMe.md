# Atomic Spectral Line

I wrote this program to generate a plot for the atomic spectrum. This is main case of my Bachelor of Science Thesis. 
Using the alpha spectrometer at the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Cracow, I read the number of counts for given radioactive elements. 
> Number of counts represent the sum of the counts in a fixed spectral region or the integration of functions fitted to the shape of the spectral lines.

Each sample taken is from the Suntar-Khayata mountain range.
